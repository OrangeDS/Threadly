### Install Using Swift Package Manager
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a
decentralized dependency manager for Swift.

1. Add the project to your `Package.swift`.

    ```swift
    import PackageDescription

    let package = Package(
        name: "MyAwesomeProject",
        dependencies: [
            .Package(url: "https://github.com/nvzqz/Threadly.git",
                     majorVersion: 4)
        ]
    )
    ```

2. Import the Threadly module.

    ```swift
    import Threadly
    ```

### Install Using CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a centralized dependency manager for
Objective-C and Swift. Go [here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/index.html)
to learn more.

1. Add the project to your [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html).

    ```ruby
    use_frameworks!

    pod 'Threadly', '~> 1.0.0'
    ```

    If you want to be on the bleeding edge, replace the last line with:

    ```ruby
    pod 'Threadly', :git => 'https://github.com/nvzqz/Threadly.git'
    ```

2. Run `pod install` and open the `.xcworkspace` file to launch Xcode.

3. Import the Threadly framework.

    ```swift
    import Threadly
    ```

### Install Using Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency
manager for Objective-C and Swift.

    ```
    github "nvzqz/Threadly"
    ```

2. Run `carthage update` and follow [the additional steps](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#getting-started)
   in order to add Threadly to your project.

3. Import the Threadly framework.

    ```swift
    import Threadly
